                <p class="one">Anime is a word derived from “animation” and is used by Japanese
                    people to refer to any animated drawings, no matter their country of
                    origin. In English, it is mostly used to refer specifically to 
                    Japanese animation. Anime is hand-drawn and computer animation originating
                    from Japan. In Japanese, anime, a term derived from the English word animation,
                    describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Outside
                    of Japan, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan,
                    or to its common style, which has since been adopted by a minority
                    of works produced in other countries.</p>
                <p>Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have
                    adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art,
                    characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and
                    individualistic techniques. Compared to Western animation, anime
                    production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail
                    of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and
                    angle shots. Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions
                    and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature
                        being large and emotive eyes.</p>

                    including major studios like Studio Ghibli, Sunrise, and Toei Animation. Since 
                    the 1980s, the medium has also seen international success with the rise of foreign 
                    dubbed and subtitled programming. As of 2016, Japanese anime accounted for 60% of 
                    the world's animated television shows.</p>
        


            
                <h4 class="two">HISTORY</h4>
                    <p>The history of Japanese anime goes back to the infancy of animation
                        throughout the world. Seitaro Kitayama is one of the first to get
                        involved, since 1917. At the time, however, animation was mostly
                        used in the context of anti-American propaganda. After 1945, and
                        becoming the world’s second largest producer of animation, 
                        Japanese people are heavily influenced by number one: the United
                        States.Osamu Tezuka, considered the father of modern manga, becomes famous
                        through the success of Astro Boy ,
                        which received an animated adaptation in 1963. He is also
                        known for Jungle Emperor Leo ,
                        first released between 1965 and 1966. The 60’s have also seen multiple series like Sally the Witch 
                         in 1966, GeGeGe no Kitarō 
                        , in 1967, and Sazae-san in 1969. 
                        The latter became so successful that the series owns a Guinness 
                        world record for the longest broadcast (over 45 years!).</p>
            

                
            <h4 class="three">Industry</h4>
                    <p>The animation industry consists of more than 430 production companies with
                        some of the major studios including Toei Animation, Gainax, Madhouse, Gonzo,
                        Sunrise, Bones, TMS Entertainment, Nippon Animation, P.A.Works, Studio Pierrot
                        and Studio Ghibli.Many of the studios are organized into a trade association,
                        The Association of Japanese Animations. There is also a labor union for workers
                        in the industry, the Japanese Animation Creators Association. Studios will often
                        work together to produce more complex and costly projects, as done with Studio
                        Ghibli's Spirited Away. An anime episode can cost between US$100,000 and
                        US$300,000 to produce. In 2001, animation accounted for 7% of the Japanese
                        film market, above the 4.6% market share for live-action works. The popularity 
                        and success of anime is seen through the profitability of the DVD market, 
                        contributing nearly 70% of total sales. According to a 2016 article on Nikkei
                        Asian Review, Japanese television stations have bought over ¥60 billion worth 
                        of anime from production companies "over the past few years", compared with
                        under ¥20 billion from overseas. There has been a rise in sales of shows
                        to television stations in Japan, caused by late night anime with adults 
                        as the target demographic. This type of anime is less popular outside 
                        apan, being considered "more of a niche product". Spirited Away (2001)
                        is the all-time highest-grossing film in Japan. It was also the 
                        highest-grossing anime film worldwide until it was overtaken by Makoto 
                        Shinkai's 2016 film Your Name. Anime films represent a large part of 
                        the highest-grossing Japanese films yearly in Japan, with 6 out of the 
                        top 10 in 2014, in 2015 and also in 2016.</p>
                    <p>Anime has to be licensed by companies in other countries in order to be legally
                        released. While anime has been licensed by its Japanese owners for use outside
                        Japan since at least the 1960s, the practice became well-established in the 
                        United States in the late 1970s to early 1980s, when such TV series as Gatchaman
                        and Captain Harlock were licensed from their Japanese parent companies for
                        distribution in the US market. The trend towards American distribution of 
                        anime continued into the 1980s with the licensing of titles such as Voltron 
                        and the 'creation' of new series such as Robotech through use of source material
                        from several original series.</p>

                <h4 class="four">Popularity</h4>
                    <p>Throughout the world, the Star Wars saga from George Lucas made its mark on the world of
                        entertainment as a merchandising and fandom (the subculture belonging to a community of fans)
                        phenomenon. Japan is no different: something similar happened in neighborhoods like Akihabara,
                        in Tokyo, where the concept of otaku thrives. Moreover, Akihabara is considered to be the place
                        to be for all Japanese anime fans.</p>
                    <p>In the 1980’s, Japanese anime goes through a visual quality renewal thanks to a new generation
                        of directors. The leader is unquestionably Hayao Miyazaki, who in 1985, founded Studio Ghibli
                        . His films were seen around the world
                        and won numerous awards, both in Japan and internationally, including the Oscar for best animated
                        film for the movie Spirited Away in 2003.</p>
                    <p>Amongst this same generation of directors, others also made their mark, such as Isao Takahata with
                        Grave of the Fireflies, Katsuhiro Ōtomo with Akira, and Mamoru
                        Ishii with Ghost in the Shell.</p>
                    <p>The 1990’s are known for the exportation and broadcast of several animated series in various countries, 
                        which made an impression on a generation of children. You most likely know Dragon Ball,
                         Sailor Moon, Neon Genesis Evangelion 
                         (Shin Seiki Evangerion), Cardcaptor Sakura, and
                          One Piece.</p>
